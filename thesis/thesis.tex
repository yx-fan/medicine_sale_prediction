Accurate and efficient drug inventory management is crucial for hospital pharmacies to avoid overstocking, minimize wastage, and ensure continuous patient care. This study proposes a hybrid forecasting framework integrating XGBoost, SARIMAX, and Prophet to improve monthly consumption predictions at the drug-manufacturer level. Through rolling-window forecasting and advanced feature engineering, the proposed approach addresses challenges such as seasonality, trend shifts, and sparse data.

\section{Introduction}

Maintaining optimal inventory levels is critical for hospital pharmacies to ensure uninterrupted patient care. Accurate drug consumption predictions help avoid overstocking, minimize wastage, and reduce operational costs. However, predicting drug usage is challenging due to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Seasonality:} Drug usage often follows seasonal trends influenced by external factors like flu seasons or epidemics.
    \item \textbf{Sparse Data:} Certain drug-manufacturer pairs have insufficient or highly sparse consumption data, complicating model training.
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Patterns:} Consumption patterns shift over time due to changes in medical practices or unexpected demand spikes.
\end{itemize}

Traditional forecasting methods such as ARIMA struggle to capture the complexities of such data, particularly when trends, seasonality, and sparse data interact. This study introduces a hybrid framework combining machine learning and statistical approaches to address these challenges. By integrating XGBoost, SARIMAX, and Prophet, the framework leverages their complementary strengths to enhance prediction accuracy.

\section{Methodologies}

\subsection{Hybrid Framework}
The proposed framework integrates three complementary models:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{XGBoost:} Captures nonlinear relationships and complex interactions through tree-based gradient boosting.
    \item \textbf{SARIMAX:} Models seasonality and long-term trends while incorporating exogenous variables.
    \item \textbf{Prophet:} Decomposes time-series data into trend and seasonal components, offering robust performance for irregular patterns.
\end{itemize}

Each model contributes unique capabilities. XGBoost handles short-term predictions effectively, SARIMAX captures long-term trends, and Prophet excels in handling irregular seasonal patterns.

\subsection{SARIMAX with Exogenous Variables}
SARIMAX extends the traditional ARIMA model by incorporating external (exogenous) variables, denoted as \( X_t \). The SARIMAX model is represented as:
\begin{equation}
    y_t = \phi(B) \theta(B)^{-1} \left( c + \mathbf{X}_t \beta + \epsilon_t \right),
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( y_t \): The target variable (e.g., monthly drug consumption).
    \item \( \phi(B) \): The autoregressive (AR) operator.
    \item \( \theta(B) \): The moving average (MA) operator.
    \item \( c \): A constant term.
    \item \( \mathbf{X}_t \): A vector of exogenous variables at time \( t \).
    \item \( \beta \): The coefficient vector for \( \mathbf{X}_t \).
    \item \( \epsilon_t \): White noise error term.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Exogenous Variables}
To enhance prediction accuracy, the following exogenous variables are included:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item **Lagged Values**:
    \begin{align}
    \text{lag}_k = y_{t-k}, \quad k \in \{1, 3, 6, 12\},
    \end{align}
    capturing the delayed impact of past consumption.

    \item **Rolling Statistics**:
    \begin{align}
    \text{Rolling Mean}_k &= \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^k y_{t-i}, \\
    \text{Rolling Std}_k &= \sqrt{\frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^k (y_{t-i} - \text{Mean})^2},
    \end{align}
    representing the moving average and variability over a specified window.

    \item **Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA)**:
    \begin{equation}
    \text{EWMA}_\alpha = \alpha y_t + (1 - \alpha) \cdot \text{EWMA}_{\alpha, t-1},
    \end{equation}
    emphasizing recent observations with a smoothing factor \( \alpha \).

    \item **Seasonality Variables**:
    Monthly seasonality is encoded using trigonometric functions:
    \begin{align}
    \text{Month\_sin} &= \sin\left( \frac{2 \pi \cdot \text{Month}}{12} \right), \\
    \text{Month\_cos} &= \cos\left( \frac{2 \pi \cdot \text{Month}}{12} \right).
    \end{align}

    \item **Percentage Change**:
    Measuring relative changes over time:
    \begin{align}
    \text{Pct\_Change}_1 &= \frac{y_t - y_{t-1}}{y_{t-1}}, \\
    \text{Pct\_Change}_3 &= \frac{y_t - y_{t-3}}{y_{t-3}}.
    \end{align}

    \item **Trend and Volatility**:
    \begin{align}
    \text{Trend Strength} &= \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^k |y_{t-i} - y_{t-i-1}|, \\
    \text{Volatility} &= \text{Rolling Std}_k.
    \end{align}
\end{enumerate}

These variables capture both historical patterns and contextual dynamics, enabling SARIMAX to model complex dependencies.

\subsection{Dynamic Feature Engineering}

Feature engineering is crucial for enhancing model performance. Besides the exogenous variables described above, outlier detection is a key preprocessing step:

\subsubsection{Outlier Detection and Handling}
Outliers can distort predictions and degrade model performance. This study employs two approaches for outlier detection:

1. **Z-score Method**:
   The Z-score for each data point \( y_i \) is calculated as:
   \begin{equation}
   Z_i = \frac{y_i - \mu}{\sigma},
   \end{equation}
   where \( \mu \) is the mean and \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation of the dataset. Data points with \( |Z_i| > 3 \) are identified as outliers.

2. **Interquartile Range (IQR) Method**:
   The IQR is defined as:
   \begin{equation}
   \text{IQR} = Q_3 - Q_1,
   \end{equation}
   where \( Q_1 \) and \( Q_3 \) are the 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively. A data point \( y_i \) is considered an outlier if:
   \begin{equation}
   y_i < Q_1 - 1.5 \cdot \text{IQR} \quad \text{or} \quad y_i > Q_3 + 1.5 \cdot \text{IQR}.
   \end{equation}

To mitigate the effect of outliers, values exceeding these thresholds are capped at the 5th and 95th percentiles of the data distribution:
\begin{equation}
y_i = 
\begin{cases} 
\text{Percentile}_5, & \text{if } y_i < \text{Percentile}_5 \\
\text{Percentile}_{95}, & \text{if } y_i > \text{Percentile}_{95}.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Rolling-Window Forecasting}
To adapt to dynamic consumption patterns, a rolling-window mechanism is implemented. At each prediction step \( t \), the model is trained using historical data \( \{y_1, y_2, \dots, y_t\} \), and the prediction for \( t+1 \) is made. The window then updates to include the latest observation, ensuring that the model adapts to recent trends.

\subsection{Baseline Methods for Comparison}
To evaluate the effectiveness of the hybrid framework, we compare it with the following baseline methods:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{ARIMA:} A traditional time-series forecasting method known for its simplicity in modeling linear trends and seasonality.
    \item \textbf{Random Forest:} A tree-based machine learning method that models nonlinear relationships effectively but lacks explicit time-series handling.
    \item \textbf{LSTM:} A recurrent neural network model designed for sequential data, suitable for capturing long-term dependencies in time-series forecasting.
    \item \textbf{DeepAR:} A probabilistic forecasting model that uses autoregressive recurrent networks to handle sparse or intermittent demand effectively.
\end{itemize}

\section{Experiments}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
The dataset consists of monthly drug consumption records, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Drug Name
    \item Manufacturer
    \item Monthly Consumption
\end{itemize}

Models are evaluated using the following metrics:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):}
    \begin{equation}
    \text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \left( y_i - \hat{y}_i \right)^2}.
    \end{equation}

    \item \textbf{Mean Absolute Error (MAE):}
    \begin{equation}
    \text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \left| y_i - \hat{y}_i \right|.
    \end{equation}

    \item \textbf{Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE):}
    \begin{equation}
    \text{SMAPE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\left| y_i - \hat{y}_i \right|}{\left( |y_i| + |\hat{y}_i| \right) / 2} \times 100\%.
    \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
