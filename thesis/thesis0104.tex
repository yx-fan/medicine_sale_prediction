\section{Introduction}

Drug consumption forecasting plays a critical role in hospital pharmacy inventory management. Accurate predictions enable hospital pharmacies to ensure drug availability while minimizing costs associated with overstocking or stockouts. As highlighted by Koala et al.~\cite{koala2021factors}, forecasting drug consumption is particularly challenging due to numerous influencing factors, such as sociodemographic characteristics, morbidity patterns, drug price index, and seasonal factors like disease outbreaks or policy changes. This study aims to develop a hybrid forecasting framework tailored to address these challenges by integrating XGBoost, Prophet, and SARIMAX with rolling-window forecasting and advanced feature engineering.  

In previous studies, various forecasting techniques have been proposed to address one or more of these complexities. Taylor and Letham~\cite{taylor2018forecasting} introduce Prophet, a scalable forecasting method designed for large-scale applications, focusing on capturing general trends and seasonality with changepoint detection. However, Prophet is limited in handling external variables and often requires careful tuning to avoid overfitting to local patterns. Machine learning techniques, such as XGBoost proposed by Chen and Guestrin~\cite{chen2016xgboost}, effectively model non-linear relationships but struggle with sequential dependencies in time-series data. 

Furthermore, comparative and hybrid studies like those by Ferreira et al.~\cite{ferreira2018forecast} and Meng et al.~\cite{meng2021comparative} highlight that while LSTM improves non-linear pattern recognition compared to ARIMA and Prophet excels in handling sparse data, both face challenges with computational complexity and adaptability. Xu et al.~\cite{xu2019hybrid} demonstrate a hybrid approach combining linear regression and LSTM networks, which improves temporal forecasting but struggles with capturing complex, non-linear interactions across diverse datasets. Siddiqui et al.~\cite{siddiqui2021hybrid} explore hybrid models like ARIMA-Holt’s Winter, which improve upon traditional statistical methods but rely heavily on fixed architectures, limiting adaptability in dynamic environments. Rathipriya et al.~\cite{rathipriya2022pharma} utilize hybrid neural networks to address temporal patterns but face challenges with data sparsity and computational efficiency. 

In this study, to address the above limitations, our proposed framework introduces rolling-window forecasting to adjust predictions for non-stationary data and shifting trends dynamically, along with advanced feature engineering that enriches the data with lag features and trend indicators, capturing both short-term dependencies and long-term dynamics. These techniques are seamlessly integrated with hybrid complementary models: XGBoost, which models non-linear relationships and feature interactions; SARIMAX, which incorporates external variables and seasonality; and Prophet, which handles trend decomposition and missing data. This synergy provides a robust and versatile solution to the unique challenges of drug consumption forecasting, making the framework applicable across various drug types and manufacturers.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II details the methodology, including data preprocessing and model design. Section III presents experimental results and discussions, highlighting the advantages of the proposed framework. Finally, Section IV concludes the study and outlines future research directions.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Dataset}
The dataset used in this study consists of monthly drug consumption records collected from various hospital pharmacies between January 1, 2018, and September 1, 2024. The data include a diverse range of drugs across multiple categories and manufacturers, ensuring a comprehensive representation of pharmaceutical demand. Each record contains the drug name, manufacturer, monthly consumption values, inventory levels, and associated features such as proportions and trends. This dataset provides a robust foundation for developing and testing the proposed forecasting framework.

\subsection{Data Processing}
A comprehensive preprocessing pipeline was applied to ensure data quality and consistency, while focusing on key steps relevant to our framework. Missing values in critical features were interpolated where possible, and records with excessive missing data were excluded to maintain dataset integrity.

Outliers in consumption data were addressed using a rolling-window approach. For each drug-manufacturer combination, rolling statistics such as mean and standard deviation were computed over a seven-month window. Values exceeding three standard deviations from the mean or falling outside the 5th and 95th percentiles were flagged as anomalies and adjusted to boundary values to preserve the time series' continuity.

To ensure the dataset included only high-quality samples for modeling, groups with fewer than six months of non-zero consumption data or those exhibiting extreme sparsity were excluded. Temporal autocorrelation of consumption data was assessed, and groups failing to exhibit sufficient autocorrelation were removed. Additional filtering criteria included variance thresholds and limits on skewness to avoid heavily imbalanced target distributions.

Feature engineering was performed to enhance the dataset's predictive power. Derived features such as lagged consumption values (e.g., previous month’s consumption), rolling statistics (e.g., mean, variance, and percent changes), and seasonality indicators encoded with trigonometric functions were created to capture temporal dependencies and periodic trends. These steps ensured that the final dataset was robust, informative, and well-suited for downstream predictive modeling tasks.

\subsection{Hybrid Model Framework}

\begin{itemize}
    \item For the Prophet model, we introduced a parameter grid search to optimize critical hyperparameters such as seasonality mode and changepoint prior scale. This enables the model to better adapt to seasonal and trend changes in pharmaceutical data. Additionally, a rolling forecast strategy was implemented to dynamically adjust predictions over different time windows, improving robustness in real-world scenarios.
    \item The SARIMAX component is enriched with advanced feature engineering, including lag features, rolling statistics (mean and standard deviation), exponentially weighted moving averages (EWMA), percentage change rates, and trend strength indicators. These features capture both short-term dependencies and long-term trends, addressing the limitations of traditional SARIMAX models in handling complex temporal patterns.
    \item XGBoost was employed to model non-linear relationships and feature interactions effectively. By designing lag and rolling features that capture time dependencies and leveraging grid search for optimal hyperparameter selection, the model achieves superior accuracy in rolling forecasts, even for sparse and irregular datasets.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{SARIMAX with Exogenous Variables}
SARIMAX extends the traditional ARIMA model by incorporating external (exogenous) variables, denoted as \(X_{t}\). The SARIMAX model is represented as:

\begin{equation}
y_{t}=\phi(B)\theta(B)^{-1}\left(c+\mathbf{X}_{t}\beta+\epsilon_{t}\right),
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(y_{t}\): The target variable (e.g., monthly drug consumption).
    \item \(\phi(B)\): The autoregressive (AR) operator.
    \item \(\theta(B)\): The moving average (MA) operator.
    \item \(c\): A constant term.
    \item \(\mathbf{X}_{t}\): A vector of exogenous variables at time \(t\).
    \item \(\beta\): The coefficient vector for \(\mathbf{X}_{t}\).
    \item \(\epsilon_{i}\): White noise error term.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Exogenous Variables}
To enhance prediction accuracy, the following exogenous variables are included:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Lagged Values}:
    \begin{equation}
    \text{lag}_{k}=y_{t-k},\quad k\in\{1,3,6,12\},
    \end{equation}
    capturing the delayed impact of past consumption.

    \item \textbf{Rolling Statistics}:
    \begin{equation}
    \text{Rolling Mean}_{k}=\frac{1}{k}\sum_{i=1}^{k}y_{t-i},
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
    \text{Rolling Std}_{k}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{k}\sum_{i=1}^{k}(y_{t-i}-\text{Mean})^{2}},
    \end{equation}
    representing the moving average and variability over a specified window.

    \item \textbf{Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA)}:
    \begin{equation}
    \text{EWMA}_{\alpha}=\alpha y_{t}+(1-\alpha)\cdot\text{EWMA}_{\alpha,t-1},
    \end{equation}
    emphasizing recent observations with a smoothing factor \(\alpha\).

    \item \textbf{Seasonality Variables}: Monthly seasonality is encoded using trigonometric functions:
    \begin{equation}
    \text{Month\_sin}=\sin\left(\frac{2\pi\cdot\text{Month}}{12}\right),
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
    \text{Month\_cos}=\cos\left(\frac{2\pi\cdot\text{Month}}{12}\right).
    \end{equation}

    \item \textbf{Percentage Change}: Measuring relative changes over time:
    \begin{equation}
    \text{Pet\_Change}_{1}=\frac{y_{t}-y_{t-1}}{y_{t-1}},
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
    \text{Pet\_Change}_{3}=\frac{y_{t}-y_{t-3}}{y_{t-3}}.
    \end{equation}

    \item \textbf{Trend and Volatility}:
    \begin{equation}
    \text{Trend Strength}=\frac{1}{k}\sum_{i=1}^{k}|y_{t-i}-y_{t-t-1}|,
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
    \text{Volatility}=\text{Rolling Std}_{k}.
    \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

These variables capture both historical patterns and contextual dynamics, enabling SARIMAX to model complex dependencies.

\subsection{XGBoost Model}
XGBoost is a gradient boosting model that constructs an ensemble of decision trees to predict the target variable. It excels at capturing non-linear relationships and interactions in the data. For time-series forecasting, exogenous features and rolling-window predictions are incorporated.

The XGBoost model can be represented as:

\begin{equation}
\hat{y}_{t}=F(x_{t})=\sum_{k=1}^{K}f_{k}(x_{t}),\quad f_{k}\in\mathcal{F},
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\hat{y}_{t}\): The predicted value at time \(t\),
    \item \(x_{t}\): The input features (e.g., lagged values, rolling mean, seasonality),
    \item \(f_{k}\): The \(k\)-th decision tree,
    \item \(\mathcal{F}\): The function space of decision trees.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Model Training}
The XGBoost model is trained iteratively using a rolling-window approach. At each iteration, a grid search is performed over the following hyperparameter space:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Number of estimators (n\_estimators): [100, 200, 300],
    \item Learning rate (learning\_rate): [0.01, 0.05, 0.1],
    \item Maximum tree depth (max\_depth): [3, 5, 7],
    \item Subsample ratio (subsample): [0.8, 1.0],
    \item Column sampling (colsample\_bytree): [0.8, 1.0].
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Prophet Model}
Prophet is a time-series forecasting model developed by Facebook that explicitly decomposes the data into trend, seasonality, and holiday components. It is particularly effective for handling missing values, outliers, and irregular patterns in the data.

The model can be represented as:

\begin{equation}
y_{t}=g(t)+s(t)+h(t)+\epsilon_{t},
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(g(t)\): Trend component, representing long-term growth or decay,
    \item \(s(t)\): Seasonal component, modeled using Fourier series,
    \item \(h(t)\): Holiday effects or special events,
    \item \(\epsilon_{t}\): White noise error term.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Parameter Tuning}
Prophet's key hyperparameters include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item seasonality\_mode: Additive or multiplicative,
    \item changepoint\_prior\_scale: Controls flexibility of the trend component,
    \item seasonality\_prior\_scale: Controls the weight of seasonal components.
\end{itemize}

A grid search over these parameters is performed to identify the optimal configuration for each drug-manufacturer combination.

\subsection{Dynamic Feature Engineering}
Feature engineering is crucial for enhancing model performance. Besides the exogenous variables described above, outlier detection is a key preprocessing step.

\subsubsection{Outlier Detection and Handling}
Outliers can distort predictions and degrade model performance. This study employs two approaches for outlier detection:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Z-score Method}: The Z-score for each data point \(y_{i}\) is calculated as:
    \begin{equation}
    Z_{i}=\frac{y_{i}-\mu}{\sigma},
    \end{equation}
    where \(\mu\) is the mean and \(\sigma\) is the standard deviation of the dataset. Data points with \(|Z_{i}|>3\) are identified as outliers.

    \item \textbf{Interquartile Range (IQR) Method}: The IQR is defined as:
    \begin{equation}
    \text{IQR}=Q_{3}-Q_{1},
    \end{equation}
    where \(Q_{1}\) and \(Q_{3}\) are the 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively. A data point \(y_{i}\) is considered an outlier if:
    \begin{equation}
    y_{i}<Q_{1}-1.5\cdot\text{IQR}\quad\text{or}\quad y_{i}>Q_{3}+1.5\cdot\text{IQR}.
    \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

To mitigate the effect of outliers, values exceeding these thresholds are capped at the 5th and 95th percentiles of the data distribution:

\begin{equation}
y_{i}=\begin{cases}\text{Percentiles},&\text{if }y_{i}<\text{Percentiles}\\ \text{Percentile}_{95},&\text{if }y_{i}>\text{Percentile}_{95}.\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Rolling-Window Forecasting}
To adapt to dynamic consumption patterns, a rolling-window mechanism is implemented. At each prediction step \(t\), the model is trained using historical data \(\{y_{1},y_{2},\ldots,y_{t}\}\), and the prediction for \(t+1\) is made. The window then updates to include the latest observation, ensuring that the model adapts to recent trends.

\section{Experiments}
\subsection{Experimental Setup}
The dataset consists of monthly drug consumption records, including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Drug Name
    \item Manufacturer
    \item Monthly Consumption
\end{itemize}

Models are evaluated using the following metrics:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)}:
    \begin{equation}
    \text{RMSE}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_{i}-\hat{y}_{i})^{2}}.
    \end{equation}

    \item \textbf{Mean Absolute Error (MAE)}:
    \begin{equation}
    \text{MAE}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}|y_{i}-\hat{y}_{i}|\,.
    \end{equation}

    \item \textbf{Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE)}:
    \begin{equation}
    \text{SMAPE}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{|y_{i}-\hat{y}_{i}|}{(|y_{i}|+|\hat{y}_{i}|)/2}\times 100\%.
    \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Results}
The performance of the models is summarized in Table I.

\section{Discussion and Future Work}
\subsection{Model Comparison and Hybrid Framework}
While each model has unique strengths and limitations, integrating their complementary capabilities within a hybrid framework provides significant advantages:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{XGBoost} handles nonlinear relationships effectively.
    \item \textbf{SARIMAX} captures seasonality and leverages external variables.
    \item \textbf{Prophet} provides robust decomposition of trend and seasonality.
\end{itemize}

The hybrid approach enables the framework to adapt to different data characteristics, achieving better overall prediction performance. For example, SARIMAX improves accuracy when seasonality dominates, whereas XGBoost captures complex interactions in data with dynamic patterns.

\subsection{Future Work}
To further improve drug inventory predictions, the following directions are proposed for future research:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hybrid Framework Expansion}: Extend the hybrid framework by integrating additional models, such as LightGBM, Transformer-based architectures, or ensemble methods to capture both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends.
    \item \textbf{External Variable Enrichment}: Explore additional exogenous variables such as patient inflow, epidemic outbreak data, seasonal illnesses (e.g., flu seasons), or hospital-specific factors to improve prediction accuracy.
    \item \textbf{Automated Model Selection}: Implement automated hyperparameter tuning and model selection techniques (e.g., Bayesian optimization) to improve forecasting performance with minimal manual intervention.
\end{itemize}

By addressing these areas, the proposed framework can become a more robust and scalable solution for hospital pharmacy inventory management, ensuring continuous patient care and reducing operational inefficiencies.

\section{Conclusion}
This study evaluated the performance of XGBoost, SARIMAX, and Prophet for drug inventory prediction in hospital pharmacies. The main findings are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item XGBoost outperformed SARIMAX and Prophet in terms of RMSE and SMAPE for short-term predictions.
    \item SARIMAX demonstrated better performance when external (exogenous) variables were included and seasonal trends dominated the data.
    \item Prophet performed well in capturing long-term seasonality and trends but showed limitations in handling highly sparse data.
\end{itemize}

The hybrid framework, by combining these models, shows promise for improving prediction accuracy and robustness. Future work will focus on integrating real-time data streams and exploring additional hybrid models, such as Transformer-based architectures, to further enhance predictive capabilities.
